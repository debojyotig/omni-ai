I'm building omni-ai, an intelligent investigation agent platform using Mastra.ai.

Context:
- Read CLAUDE.md for complete project overview
- Check .claude-code/CHECKPOINT.md for current workstream status
- Follow the active workstream checkpoint in .claude-code/checkpoints/

Implementation Guidelines:
1. Follow the current workstream checkpoint tasks in order
2. Use official Mastra structure (src/mastra/ for all Mastra code)
3. Reference omni-agent for UI/styling (.claude-code/references/omni-agent-codebase.md)
4. Use MCP servers configured in .mcp.json:
   - Mastra Docs Server for Mastra documentation
   - shadcn MCP for installing components
5. Test after each task completion
6. Update checkpoint progress as you work

Quality Standards:
- Follow official Mastra project structure (src/mastra/)
- Copy styling exactly from omni-agent (Tailwind HSL colors, Inter font)
- Use Mastra Memory (not custom Zustand chat-store)
- All agents in src/mastra/agents/
- MCP integration in src/mastra/mcp/
- Main entry point: src/mastra/index.ts (not instance.ts)

Current Goal: Complete the active workstream checkpoint with high quality implementation.

Let's start! What's the current checkpoint status?
